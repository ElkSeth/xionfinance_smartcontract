!! XGWallet was not proxy safe since some of the storage variables were hardcoded values. I moved xgt and xgtAddress to be set when initialize is called.

Setup: 
    Requires polygonscan.com API Key in order to use verification feature when deploying.
    Secret Key for deployer account and polygonscan API Key go in .secret.json file.

XGHub:
    Change XGT_ADDRESS variable if the address is not correct.
        - This is true for all of the deployment scripts.
XGWallet/XGSubscriptions/XGPurchases/XGFeatureRegistry:
    Change XGHubProxy variable to correct address before deploying.
InitXGHub
    Change list of contract addresses before deploying.

Order:
    XGHub > XGWallet > XGSubscriptions > XGPurchases > XGFeatureRegistry

Command:
    ex. npx hardhat run ./deploy/deploy-XGHub.js --network polygon
