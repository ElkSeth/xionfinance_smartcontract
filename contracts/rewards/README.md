# Xion Global Smart Contracts

The Xion Global smart contracts running on the xDai chain powering the Xion Global shopping ecosystem.

## Smart Contracts

### Upgradeability

We are leveraging the Upgradeability features by OpenZeppelin, allowing us to introduce features without changing the contract's address as well as fixing any unforeseen bugs that could lead to a financial loss for our users. The safety of our users and consequently their funds is of utmost importance to us!
However, we are **not** using this feature for the token itself, in order to maintain decentralization and not even having the possibility to gain access to our users funds.
